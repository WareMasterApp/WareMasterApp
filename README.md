# 🚀 Warehouse Management API  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Warehouse Management API** is designed to efficiently manage multiple warehouses, each containing various product categories such as groceries, tools, plants, and clothing. This API facilitates **warehouse operations, inventory tracking, and product management** while ensuring secure user authentication and role-based access control.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose  
- **Authentication:** Passport.js (Local Strategy & Google OAuth), JWT  
- **API Documentation:** Swagger  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

## 🔑 Authentication & Security  
- **JWT-based authentication** for session management  
- **OAuth (Google Login)** for third-party authentication  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to restrict user permissions  
- **HTTPS enforced** for secure data transmission  
- **Input validation & sanitization** to prevent SQL Injection & XSS attacks  
- **CORS implemented** for secure API access  

## 📂 Database Structure  
The API uses MongoDB with the following **collections**:  
- **Brand** – Stores brand-related details  
- **Inventory** – Manages stock levels within warehouses  
- **Products** – Contains product information  
- **User** – Stores user authentication and role-based access data  
- **Warehouse** – Maintains warehouse details  
- **Account** – Handles account-related settings  

## 📌 Development Approach  
### **Task Management & Workflow**  
To ensure incremental development and efficient task management, we use **Trello** for tracking progress and prioritizing tasks based on team availability.  

### **Task Breakdown**  
- ✅ **Project Setup**: Initialize Node.js project & create Git repo  
- ✅ **Database Configuration**: Set up MongoDB with Mongoose  
- ✅ **API Development**: Implement HTTP GET, POST, PUT, DELETE routes  
- ✅ **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement JWT & OAuth authentication  
- ✅ **API Documentation**: Use Swagger for API route documentation  
- ✅ **Testing & Debugging**: Ensure all endpoints function correctly  
- ✅ **Final Presentation**: Record a video showcasing API functionality  

## ⚠️ Potential Risks & Mitigation Strategies  
### **Risks**  
- **Team Availability**: Scheduling conflicts may delay development  
- **Technical Complexities**: Integration with external services (OAuth, Swagger) may require additional time  
- **Unexpected Delays**: Dependencies on third-party services could slow progress  

### **Mitigation Strategies**  
- **Task Breakdown & Prioritization**: Using **Trello** to track and distribute work effectively  
- **Regular Communication**: Team check-ins to address blockers early  
- **Buffer Time**: Adding extra time for complex integrations  
- **Security Best Practices**: Implementing robust security measures from the start  

## 📜 API Documentation  
API documentation is available via **Swagger**, providing detailed descriptions of each route and expected request/response formats.  

## 📽️ Final Deliverable  
A video presentation will demonstrate:  
- API routes functioning correctly  
- Database operations modifying MongoDB data  
- API documentation walkthrough
